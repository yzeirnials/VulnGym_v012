and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [0.1.4-cleaned-verify1] — 2026-07-09

Experiment fork cleanup — retain only human-audited VulnGym entries for formal
benchmark runs.

### Changed
- Filtered `data/entries.jsonl` from **408 → 393**
  rows by keeping only `verify = 1`.
- Filtered `data/reports.jsonl` from **184 → 178**
  rows by removing reports with no retained verified entries.
- Recomputed `entry_ids` and `num_entries` for **4**
  originally partially verified reports.

### Added
- Endpoint-level ground-truth views: `data/entry_points.jsonl` (350 anchors) and `data/critical_operations.jsonl` (356 anchors).
- Endpoint-level recall evaluators: `examples/evaluate_entry_points.py` and `examples/evaluate_critical_operations.py`.
- Conversion-table schema/exporter: `examples/conversion_table.schema.json` and `examples/conversion_table_to_eval_inputs.py`.

## [0.1.4] — 2026-06-26

Data refresh — further expansion of human-audited coverage.

### Changed
- Human-audited entries grew from **350 → 393 / 408** (96.3 %),
  covering **178 / 184** advisories (96.7 %).
- Updated human-audit status flags only; row counts, schema, `desc`
  coverage, and vulnerability-type distribution are unchanged.

### Stats
- reports: **184** (unchanged)
- entries: **408** (unchanged)
- human-audited entries (verify = 1): **393** (was 350)
- human-audited advisories (≥ 1 verified entry): **178** (was 163)

## [0.1.3] — 2026-06-18

Data refresh — further expansion of human-audited coverage and broad annotation refinements.

### Changed
- Human-audited entries grew from **274 → 350 / 408** (85.8 %),
  covering **163 / 184** advisories (88.6 %).

### Added
- `desc` field on the `entry_point`, `critical_operation`, and `trace`
  nodes of **400** entries — a natural-language explanation of each
  node's role in the vulnerability chain.

### Stats
- reports: **184** (unchanged)
- entries: **408** (unchanged)
- human-audited entries (verify = 1): **350** (was 274)
- human-audited advisories (≥ 1 verified entry): **163** (was 137)

## [0.1.2] — 2026-05-31

Data refresh — significant expansion of human-audited coverage and annotation refinements.

### Changed
- Human-audited entries grew from **113 → 274 / 408** (67.2 %),
  covering **137 / 184** advisories (74.5 %).
- Refined `entry_point`, `critical_operation`, and `trace` annotations
  on **80** entries for improved accuracy.

### Stats
- reports: **184** (unchanged)
- entries: **408** (unchanged)
- human-audited entries (verify = 1): **274** (was 113)
- human-audited advisories (≥ 1 verified entry): **137** (was 61)

## [0.1.1] — 2026-05-15

Data refresh — adds a human-audit flag and additional human-verified entries.

### Added
- `verify` field on every row in `data/entries.jsonl` (`int`, `0` or `1`):
  `1` marks entries that have been reviewed and confirmed by a human
  annotator (high-confidence ground truth); `0` marks automatically
  annotated entries that have not yet been human-confirmed.
- **113 / 408** entries (≈ 27.7 %) are now flagged `verify = 1`,
  covering **61 / 184** advisories (≈ 33.2 %; **50** advisories have all
  of their entries verified, **11** are partially verified).

### Changed
- Refined values of selected `entry_point`, `critical_operation`, `trace`,
  and other annotation fields in `data/entries.jsonl`. Row counts and the
  `report_id` ↔ `entry_id` join structure are unchanged.
- `SCHEMA.md` now documents `verify`; `human_confirmed` is removed from
  the "intentionally omitted internal fields" invariant since the audit
  status is exposed publicly via `verify`.

### Stats
- reports: **184** (unchanged)
- entries: **408** (unchanged)
- human-audited entries (verify = 1): **113**
- human-audited advisories (≥ 1 verified entry): **61**

## [0.1.0] — 2026-05-07
